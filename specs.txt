Mini QMS – Updated MVP Product Specification (SME-First)1. Purpose & PositioningA modern, lightweight Quality Management System for SMEs to become and remain ISO 9001 audit-ready without consultants, document chaos, or enterprise complexity.Core promise:ISO 9001 made obvious, manageable, and affordable for small teams.Initial standard: ISO 9001 (MVP)Architecture designed for expansion to underserved standards (e.g. ISO 27001 SME version) using the same engine2. Target UsersOrganizationsSMEs with 5–50 employeesService-based businesses (tech, professional services, NGOs, EU-project orgs)Low QMS maturity; currently using Word, Google Docs, spreadsheets, or SharePoint hacksTypical Roles (non-formal)Founder / Director / CEOHead of IT / OperationsAdmin or operations officer handling compliance “by accident”Team leads as process owners3. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)Guided over configurable – opinionated paths beat flexible frameworksProcess-first, evidence-second – documents support reality, not replace itPlain English first, ISO language second – both always visibleAudit readiness over feature volume – every feature must map to an audit outcomeCompany-based pricing mindset – no per-seat friction for small teams4. Tenancy & Accounts (MVP)4.1 Tenancy ModelMulti-tenant SaaSOne workspace (“tenant”) per companyStrict tenant data isolation4.2 UsersUsers belong to one tenant only (MVP)Email-based invitations4.3 Roles (MVP – intentionally minimal)AdminFull accessManage usersApprove evidenceConfigure standard scopeContributorCreate and edit assigned itemsUpload evidenceCannot change tenant configurationCannot approve evidence(Future roles: Auditor, Manager, custom roles – explicitly out of MVP)5. Standards Engine (Core System Layer)A central Standards Mapping Engine powers readiness, dashboards, and future standards.5.1 Supported Standard (MVP)ISO 9001 clauses (full coverage)5.2 Clause Metadata (per clause)Clause code (e.g. 4.1, 7.5)Clause titlePlain-English explanation (“What this really means for your company”)Auditor expectation summary (“What auditors usually look for”)Required evidence types (policy, process, record, review, action)Links to relevant system modules5.3 Tenant Scope ConfigurationStandard in scope (ISO 9001 – fixed for MVP)Scope statement (free text)Clause applicability:Applicable / Not applicableJustification notes6.

Future Expansion: ISO 27001 (Post-MVP)Uses same standards engineAdds SME-focused modules:Asset registerSecurity incident logSupplier registerSimplified Statement of ApplicabilityCurated SME control subset first(No impact on MVP UX decisions)12. Non-Functional RequirementsAudit trail on key actions (create/update/approve)Archive instead of deleteStrong authenticationTenant isolationFast dashboard performance13. Explicit MVP ExclusionsDo NOT build in MVP:Custom role matricesComplex workflow automationTraining & competence managementExternal auditor portalsThird-party integrationsE-signaturesMulti-language support14.
